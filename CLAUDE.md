- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## PR Comments

<pr-comment-rule>
When I say to add a comment to a PR with a TODO on it, use 'checkbox' markdown format to add the TODO. For instance:

- [ ] A description of the todo goes here
</pr-comment-rule>

- When tagging Claude in GitHub issues, use '@claude'

## Changesets

The description of the change should be user-facing, describing which features were added or bugs were fixed.

## GitHub

- Your primary method for interacting with GitHub should be the GitHub CLI.

## Git

- When creating branches, prefix them with matt/ to indicate they came from me.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
